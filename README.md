### I don't want to mess with source code. Can I download your app on my Windows Phone?
Yep. [Right here](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/entrance/2613fe69-6167-40f8-91a0-d4c9ae1342c9).

### Can I re-distribute EnTrance in the Windows Phone Store?
Yes. Feel free to use it for **your own** podcast or someone else's podcast. Remember - legal conditions apply to you. I, the developer, am in no way responsible for your subsequent use of EnTrance in the context of your own project.
*Also*, you should not be using the EnTrance name - feel free to rename it to something else, and add a reference in the **About** dialog that the app is built on top of EnTrance source code.

### You seem to be using Azure Mobile Services for the data, but did not provide the key. Why?
I am using AMS to list the available tracks for each podcast. That data is restricted for my app **only** - feel free to build your own track database on top of Azure Mobile Services. All data harnesses are already provided. Or hook into someone else's data source, where you have the rights to do so.

### Will I always see the most recent EnTrance source code here?
Yes, minus the API keys.

### Do you offer support for this project?
If you want specific ideas implemented in the app itself, feel free to use the [Issues page](https://github.com/dend/entrance/issues). This, of course, doesn't guarantee that the feature will be implemented, but gives you the opportunity to put the feature on my radar.
